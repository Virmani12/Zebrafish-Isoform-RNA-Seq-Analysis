# zebrafish-genome-analysis

This project conducts analysis on Zebrafish RNA-Seq data between hour 2 post-fertilization and hour 6 post-fertilization to uncover gene isoforms during zebrafish embryo development. The project conducts the following steps in order:

1. Pre-processing of RNA-Seq Data
2. Log2 normalizing the difference in expression between hour 6 and hour 2 data
3. Detect isoforms over the entire dataset
4. Visualize isoforms for further analysis
