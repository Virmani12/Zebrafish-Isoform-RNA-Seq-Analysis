# zebrafish-genome-analysis

This repository does a rough analysis on Zebrafish RNA-Seq coverage data between hour 2 post-fertilization and hour 6 post-fertilization (source of the data provided in the references below). The files in this repo complete the following tasks:

1. Pre-process the hour 2 and hour 6 coverage data
2. Calculate the log2 normalized difference in coverage (Hour 6 - Hour 2) over the entire dataset
3. Detect isoforms over the entire dataset

The research question was presented through a college course as a term-long project. The course worked in groups, however, all code in this repo is solely written by me and has no other contributors.
